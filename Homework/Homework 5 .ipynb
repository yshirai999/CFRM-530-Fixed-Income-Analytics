    "Consider the workbook *TermStructure.xlsm*. The worksheet *Discount Curve* contains market quotes as of February 19 2018 for 16 liquid instruments (cells D4:D19), namely the 3 Month Libor rate, 6 eurodollar futures for medium term maturities and adjusted for convexity, and 9 swap rates for longer maturities up to 10-year (see the Bloomberg screen below). The cash flow associated with each instrument is already reported in the cells H4:AJ19, which have been conveniently named **CashFlows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a piece of software that uses Moore-Penrose inverse to calibrate a smooth zero curve. For the smoothing spline, check this library: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/interpolate/smoothing_splines.html. The keyword argument $s$ specifies the amount of smoothing to perform during the spline fit. It should be set equal to the parameter in the cell named **SmoothedSplineParameter**, and you should start by setting this parameter to $0$. The maturities for each instrument are in the cell range named **Dates**. Finally, the current prices of each instrument is in the cell range named **Prices**. Report the calculated discount rates in the range named **SmoothedDiscountCurve**. \n",
    "- Plot raw yield rates from market quotes. What do you notice?\n",
    "- Now choose the parameter $s$ so that the yield curve is increasing and $s$ is as small as possible\n",
    "- Plot the smoothed yield curve on the same figure with the raw yield rates.\n",
    "- As a matter of fact, the longer maturities in the smoothed yield curve (above 20 year) as of February 18 2018 were below the 10-year rate. What is the economic meaning of this?"

    "Now look at the worksheet *Volatility Smile*. The quotes (in terms of Black volatility) for caps is reported in cells D3:D12. Column F3:F12 shows the corresponding market price of the cap, while column G3:G12 reports the price of the cap based on the Hull-White model for Mean reversion and volatility as in cell L3 and L4 respectively.\n",
